            <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-4">Naomi-Grace / NG / Naomi / Yomz, here.</h3>
            <img src="img/graduation/grad.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-4">
            <p class="text-muted small">In case you forgot what I look like</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-4">Mentioned previously in the email that brought you here, I am formally
                inviting you to see me walk across stages for 4+ hours. In other words, you are invited to partake in a ceremony called
                <em>Graduation</em>. Specifically mine,  👩🏻‍🎓 and a few thousand others.</h3>
            <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-4">As you probably know, I've spent the past 17-ish years of my life in
                formal schooling. Notably, in the last 4 years, I've been working hard to convince my current school
                that I've learned enough about <code>"how to tell computers what to do"</code> 👩🏻‍💻 for them to
                formally and officially recognize it.</h3>

            <p class="text-muted small">Students chilling on the lawn (aka me after finals)</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-4">As of Sunday, May 6th at 12:30 in the afternoon, I have them about 117
                credits taken / 120 credits needed = <strong>97.5% convinced</strong> they should let me graduate, but
                after a couple more final grades get posted, I plan to have them 123 credits taken / 120 credits needed
                = <strong>102.5% convinced</strong>. 🎓</h3>
            <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-4">For those of you that need a refresher, I go to <strong><em>The
                University of Virginia</em></strong>, or UVA. UVA was founded in 1819 by Thomas Jefferson and is known
                for its historic foundations, Jeffersonian architecture (The Rotunda being the most iconic on grounds),
                student-run honor code, and secret societies.</h3>

            <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-4">
                <mark>Fact:</mark>
                when people play word association games, the words "fratty" and "exclusive" are among the top words to
                be associated with UVA. This graduation is going to be just that. Indeed, in typical "frat style," you
                must be <em><u>on the list</u></em>. (But instead of a list, there are tickets 🎟️.) Apparently this
                celebration is so grand, so epic, and so exclusive that it can only be seen by a few eyes. Thus, I've
                only been granted 6 tickets for each event.</h3>

            <h3 class="font-weight-normal">A. Ah, true. The degree ceremony is at 3:30 if it rains so you guys will have
                like 3ish hours to occupy. Good question. I'd reccommend driving to <a href="http://www.downtowncharlottesville.net/">Historic Downtown Charlottesville</a>, exploring
                the shops, and checking out the <a href="https://www.vadm.org/">Virginia Discovery Museum for kids</a>.
