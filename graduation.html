            <h1>Greetings,</h1>
            <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-4">Naomi-Grace / NG / Naomi / Yomz, here.</h3>
            <img src="img/graduation/insta.png" class="img-fluid mt-4">
            <p class="text-muted small">In case you forgot what I look like</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-4">Mentioned previously in the email that brought you here, I am formally
                inviting you to see me walk across stages for 4+ hours. In other words, you are invited to partake in a
                ceremony called
                <em>Graduation</em>. Specifically mine üë©üèª‚Äçüéì, and a few thousand others.</h3>
            <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-4">As you probably know, I've spent the past 17-ish years of my life in
                formal schooling. Notably, in the last 4 years, I've been working hard to convince my current school
                that I've learned enough about <code>"how to tell computers what to do"</code> üë©üèª‚Äçüíª for them to
                formally and officially recognize it.</h3>

            <img src="img/graduation/Students_On_the_Lawn_SS_17.jpg.png" class="img-fluid mt-4">
            <p class="text-muted small">Students chilling on the lawn (aka me after finals)</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-4">As of Tuesday, May 8th at 10:00 in the morning, I have them about 120
                credits taken / 120 credits needed = <strong>100.00% convinced</strong> they should let me graduate, but
                after one more final grade gets posted, I plan to have them 123 credits taken / 120 credits needed
                = <strong>102.50% convinced</strong>. üéì</h3>
            <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-4">For those of you that need a refresher, I go to <strong><em>The
                University of Virginia</em></strong>, or UVA. UVA was founded in 1819 by Thomas Jefferson and is known
                for its historic foundations, Jeffersonian architecture (The Rotunda being the most iconic on grounds),
                student-run honor code, and secret societies.</h3>

            <p class="text-muted small"><u>the</u> Rotunda</p>
            <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-4">
                <mark>Fact:</mark>
                when people play word association games, the words "fratty" and "exclusive" are among the top words to
                be associated with UVA. This graduation is going to be just that. Indeed, in typical "frat style," you
                must be <em><u>on the list</u></em>. (But instead of a list, there are tickets üéüÔ∏è.) Apparently this
                celebration is so grand, so epic, and so exclusive that it can only be seen by a few eyes. Thus, I've
                only been granted 6 tickets for each event.
            </h3>

                I have carefully selected the people who deserve to witness these epic walks. The order has been
                generated randomly by python.

                Now, what does this all entail? There will be 2 events I'll be co-staring in. Luckily they're around the
                same place (University of
                Virginia grounds) and same day (Saturday, May 19th). There are also Valedictory Exercises on grounds the
                day before on Friday, May 18th.

On the bright side, you will be able to experience a long standing UVA tradition with me that I've been looking forward to for four years üòä</h3>
                <p><strong>What really happens (from the uva finals website):</strong> Each May for Final Exercises, the graduating class, made up of undergraduate and graduate students alike, lines up around the Rotunda for the unforgettable procession down the Lawn. Tens of thousands of parents, guests and faculty members watch as the students make their way down the Lawn. The graduates sit facing away from the Rotunda, toward Old Cabell Hall, to symbolize their entrance into the world beyond the University, taking with them all of their experiences and the knowledge gained during their time on Grounds. Final Exercises begins at 10 a.m. with the procession down the Lawn. The ceremony lasts for approximately two hours.</p>
